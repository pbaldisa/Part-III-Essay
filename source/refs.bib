@book{BrownianMotion,
series = {Cambridge series on statistical and probabilistic mathematics ; 30},
abstract = {This eagerly awaited textbook covers everything the graduate student in probability wants to know about Brownian motion, as well as the latest research in the area. Starting with the construction of Brownian motion, the book then proceeds to sample path properties like continuity and nowhere differentiability. Notions of fractal dimension are introduced early and are used throughout the book to describe fine properties of Brownian paths. The relation of Brownian motion and random walk is explored from several viewpoints, including a development of the theory of Brownian local times from random walk embeddings. Stochastic integration is introduced as a tool and an accessible treatment of the potential theory of Brownian motion clears the path for an extensive treatment of intersections of Brownian paths. An investigation of exceptional points on the Brownian path and an appendix on SLE processes, by Oded Schramm and Wendelin Werner, lead directly to recent research themes.},

@book{YorRevuz,
series = {Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften, A Series of Comprehensive Studies in Mathematics, 293},
abstract = {This book focuses on the probabilistic theory ofBrownian motion. This is a good topic to center a discussion around because Brownian motion is in the intersec­ tioll of many fundamental classes of processes. It is a continuous martingale, a Gaussian process, a Markov process or more specifically a process with in­ dependent increments; it can actually be defined, up to simple transformations, as the real-valued, centered process with independent increments and continuous paths. It is therefore no surprise that a vast array of techniques may be success­ fully applied to its study and we, consequently, chose to organize the book in the following way. After a first chapter where Brownian motion is introduced, each of the following ones is devoted to a new technique or notion and to some of its applications to Brownian motion. Among these techniques, two are of para­ mount importance: stochastic calculus, the use ofwhich pervades the whole book and the powerful excursion theory, both of which are introduced in a self­ contained fashion and with a minimum of apparatus. They have made much easier the proofs of many results found in the epoch-making book of Itö and McKean: Diffusion Processes and their Sampie Paths, Springer (1965).},

@book{Diffusions,
series = {Cambridge mathematical library},
abstract = {This celebrated book has been prepared with readers' needs in mind, remaining a systematic treatment of the subject whilst retaining its vitality. The second volume follows on from the first, concentrating on stochastic integrals, stochastic differential equations, excursion theory and the general theory of processes. Much effort has gone into making these subjects as accessible as possible by providing many concrete examples that illustrate techniques of calculation, and by treating all topics from the ground up, starting from simple cases. Many of the examples and proofs are new; some important calculational techniques appeared for the first time in this book. Together with its companion volume, this book helps equip graduate students for research into a subject of great intrinsic interest and wide application in physics, biology, engineering, finance and computer science.},

@book{CantorSet,
abstract = {This textbook provides a comprehensive course in metric spaces. Presenting a smooth takeoff from basic real analysis to metric spaces, every chapter of the book presents a single concept, which is further unfolded and elaborated through related sections and subsections. Apart from a unique new presentation and being a comprehensive textbook on metric spaces, it contains some special concepts and new proofs of old results, which are not available in any other book on metric spaces. It has individual chapters on homeomorphisms and the Cantor set. This book is almost self-contained and has an abundance of examples, exercises, references and remarks about the history of basic notions and results. Every chapter of this book includes brief hints and solutions to selected exercises. It is targeted to serve as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students of mathematics. .},

abstract = {A precise meaning is given to the following intuitive statement: between the two times when it hits a double point, a Brownian motion behaves like a Brownian bridge. The main tool is the notion of intersection local time, which provides a measure on the set of double points, and hence a notion of properties of almost all double points. Results are applied to study points of infinite multiplicity of plane Brownian paths.}

title = {Brownian Motion, Martingales, and Stochastic Calculus},
year = {2018},
isbn = {331980961X},
publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
abstract = {This book offers a rigorous and self-contained presentation of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus within the general framework of continuous semimartingales. The main tools of stochastic calculus, including It's formula, the optional stopping theorem and Girsanov's theorem, are treated in detail alongside many illustrative examples. The book also contains an introduction to Markov processes, with applications to solutions of stochastic differential equations and to connections between Brownian motion and partial differential equations. The theory of local times of semimartingales is discussed in the last chapter. Since its invention by It, stochastic calculus has proven to be one of the most important techniques of modern probability theory, and has been used in the most recent theoretical advances as well as in applications to other fields such as mathematical finance. Brownian Motion, Martingales, and Stochastic Calculus provides a strong theoretical background to the reader interested in such developments. Beginning graduate or advanced undergraduate students will benefit from this detailed approach to an essential area of probability theory. The emphasis is on concise and efficient presentation, without any concession to mathematical rigor. The material has been taught by the author for several years in graduate courses at two of the most prestigious French universities. The fact that proofs are given with full details makes the book particularly suitable for self-study. The numerous exercises help the reader to get acquainted with the tools of stochastic calculus.}
